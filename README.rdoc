= USPS Address Standardizer

== Installing

  $ require 'usps_standardizer'
  $ gem install usps_standardizer

== Configuration

=== Caching

It’s a good idea, when relying on any external service, to cache retrieved data.
When implemented correctly it improves your app’s response time and stability.
It’s easy to cache usps results with USPSStandardizer, just configure a cache store:

  $ USPSStandardizer::Configuration.cache = Redis.new
  $ USPSStandardizer::Configuration.cache_prefix = "wyw"

== Usage

  $ result = USPSStandardizer.lookup_for(:address => '6216 eddington drive', :state => 'oh', :city => 'middletown')

Or you can pass your own Mechanize object to fetch the information

  $ require 'usps_standardizer'
  $ result = USPSStandardizer.lookup_for({:address => '6216 eddington drive', :state => 'oh', :city => 'middletown'})
